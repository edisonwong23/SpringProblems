## Problem 1: Number Series Finder
Description
Bob challenges Alice with number series puzzles. For a given series, Alice needs to find the nth member of that series.

Example 1:
Series: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Query: What is the 20th member?
Answer: 20

Example 2:
Series: 1 2 5 20 25 150 157 1256 ...
Bob asks: What is the 1000th member of this series?

This problem asks to create an application or function that calculates the 1000th member of the given series efficiently without manual calculation.

| Index (n) | Term |
| --------- | ---- |
| 1         | 1    |
| 2         | 2    |
| 3         | 5    |
| 4         | 20   |
| 5         | 25   |
| 6         | 150  |
| 7         | 157  |
| 8         | 1256 |
| ...       | ...  |

```bash
a(1) = 1
For even n, a(n) = a(n-1) * n
For odd n, a(n) = a(n-1) + n

n = 2 → even → term = 1 × 2 = 2
n = 3 → odd  → term = 2 + 3 = 5
n = 4 → even → term = 5 × 4 = 20
n = 5 → odd  → term = 20 + 5 = 25
```


## Problem 2: Character Replacement in a File
Description
You are given a file containing many characters, especially the letter 'a'. You need to process this file according to specific rules and print the transformed content.

Rules
Rule 1: If a single 'a' appears (not consecutive to another 'a'), replace it with '#'.

Rule 2: If multiple 'a' characters appear consecutively:

Leave the first 'a' as is.

Replace each subsequent 'a' in the consecutive sequence with '$'.

Requirements
The replacement should be case-insensitive (i.e., 'A' or 'a' treated the same).

Output the transformed content to the console.

```bash
abcdaabcdeabaaacbfaaaabcab
123aabcaabca35aa
```
```bash
#bcda$bcde#ba$$cbfa$$$bc#b
123a$bca$bc#35a$
```
